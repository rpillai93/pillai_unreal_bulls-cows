# BullCowGame
Simple word game on Unreal Engine learnt from the Gamedev course (https://www.gamedev.tv/p/bundle-the-complete-unreal-c-developer/).
The aim of the game is for the player to guess the isogram word. An isogram is a word that has no repeated letters. The word Isogram itself
is an isogram. If the player guessed a letter right but it's in the wrong position, the number of cows increment. If the player guessed the 
letter and it's position right, the number of bulls go up!
